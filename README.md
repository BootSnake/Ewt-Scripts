## Ewt Scripts

Put all .lua files in a script folder placed in your wow folder.  
You should have for example the following path: your_wow_folder/script/shared.lua  

Then launch wow, attach ewt, enable advanced lua unlock and simply load the script you need.  
Never call shared.lua yourself

* `.loadfile script/priest_disc.lua` gonna load the priest script
